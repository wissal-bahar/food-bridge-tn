						<h3>Our Mission: </h3>
						<p>At Food Bridge, we believe that no food should go to waste while there are people in need. Our <b>Food Recovery Program</b> is designed to collect surplus food from restaurants, hotels, schools, and other food establishments and redistribute it to families and individuals facing food insecurity.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>How It Works</h3>
								<p>Our dedicated team of volunteers works closely with local partners to ensure that fresh, high-quality food reaches those who need it most. Each day, we coordinate with our partners to collect food that would otherwise be discarded, sort it, and distribute it to shelters, community centers, and directly to families in need.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Featured Partners</h3>
								<ul>
								<li><b>Gourmet Green Bistro</b></li>
									<p> Every Tuesday, Gourmet Green donates leftover meals from their lunch service. Each donation serves around 50 meals, helping reduce waste while feeding those in need.</p>
								<li><b>La Bonne Table Restaurant</b> </li>
								<p>A family-owned restaurant, La Bonne Table has been a loyal partner since 2023. Twice a week, they contribute warm, nutritious meals that go straight to local shelters.</p>
								<li><b>Fresh Start Cafe</b></li>
								<p>Known for their sustainable practices, Fresh Start Cafe donates surplus sandwiches and salads every Friday, helping families kick off their weekends with healthy options.</p>
							</ul>

								<h3>Recent Events</h3>

									<li><b>Zero Waste Weekend (September 15-16, 2024)</b></li>
										<p> Our team organized a large-scale food collection over two days, working with 10 local restaurants and collecting over 300 meals for redistribution. Volunteers rallied at our collection point, making it a truly impactful community event.</p>
									<li><b>Hunger-Free Ramadan (April 2024)</b></li>
									<p>During the holy month of Ramadan, we collaborated with local mosques and restaurants like Dar Nour and Olive Grove to collect and distribute iftar meals to families in need, reaching over 1,000 people.</p>
