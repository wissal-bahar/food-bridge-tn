						<h3>Growing together : </h3>
						<p>Our <b>Community Garden Program</b> empowers neighborhoods by creating shared garden spaces where people can grow their own fruits and vegetables. These gardens foster community, support sustainable food sources, and encourage self-sufficiency for families and individuals.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>How It Works</h3>
								<p>Food Bridge collaborates with local councils, schools, and volunteers to transform vacant lots and open spaces into vibrant community gardens. We provide initial resources like soil, seeds, and gardening tools, and offer guidance to help each garden flourish. Community members are then encouraged to take ownership, cultivating crops, learning gardening skills, and enjoying fresh produce they’ve grown themselves.</p>

								<h3>Featured Partners</h3>
								<ul>
								<li><b>Green Oasis – Nabeul</b></li>
									<p>Launched in May 2024, Green Oasis has quickly become a community hub. Local residents planted tomatoes, peppers, and herbs, and the garden now produces enough fresh vegetables to support over 20 families.</p>
								<li><b>Urban Roots – Tunis</b></li>
								<p>In partnership with the local municipality, Urban Roots transformed an unused city lot into a lush garden in early 2023. This garden not only provides food but also serves as a meeting place for workshops and community events.</p>
								<li><b>Le Jardin Solidaire – Sousse</b></li>
								<p>Opened in September 2024, this garden focuses on teaching sustainable agriculture to youth. Every Saturday, volunteers hold sessions on composting, organic gardening, and seasonal planting.</p>
							</ul>

								<h3>Recent Events</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Harvest Festival (October 2024)</b></li>
										<p> To celebrate the end of the harvest season, we organized a community event at Urban Roots. Residents enjoyed fresh produce, shared gardening tips, and connected with neighbors. It was a fantastic turnout with over 100 participants!</p>
									<li><b>Planting Day (March 2024)</b></li>
									<p>Volunteers gathered at Green Oasis to kickstart the spring planting season. We planted a variety of vegetables and held a workshop on garden maintenance. The event was a huge success, bringing together local families, students, and community leaders.</p>
								</ul>
