						<h3>Changing Habits Around Food Waste</h3>
						<p>One of our biggest challenges is shifting people's attitudes toward food waste. Many individuals are unaware of the impact of wasted food or are hesitant to adopt new habits. Changing mindsets requires consistent education, awareness campaigns, and community engagement to inspire a culture of mindful consumption.</p>

								<h3>Limited Awareness of Food Security</h3>
								<p>Many people in Tunisia are unaware of the concept of food security or the importance of sustainable practices to ensure everyone has access to nutritious food. This lack of awareness affects not only food waste reduction but also the willingness of communities to participate in initiatives like community gardens. We address this by integrating educational programs into our initiatives to help people understand how small actions can lead to a big difference.</p>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Financial and Resource Constraints</h3>
								<p>Running food recovery and community garden programs requires a steady supply of funds, tools, and resources. Limited financial support can slow down our projects, limit the number of people we can reach, and restrict the impact we aim to make. To address this, we focus on fundraising, partnerships with local businesses, and sponsorships from socially responsible organizations.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Join Us!</h3>
								<p>Our Food Recovery Program is always looking for passionate volunteers and new partners. Whether you’re a restaurant owner, a volunteer, or someone who wants to make a difference, your involvement matters. Help us fight hunger, reduce food waste, and build a stronger community by joining the Food Bridge family today!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3> Building Long-Term Independence</h3>
								<p>Our goal is to create sustainable solutions that don’t rely solely on Food Bridge’s presence. However, empowering communities to take full ownership of projects, like community gardens, requires ongoing support, resources, and a strong foundation of knowledge. This challenge motivates us to invest in training, capacity-building, and mentorship programs to foster self-sustaining initiatives.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Help Us Overcome These Challenges</h3>
								<p>Each of these challenges is an opportunity for growth, and with your support, we can make an even greater impact. Whether you choose to volunteer, donate, or help spread the word, your involvement is crucial in building a hunger-free Tunisia. Together, we can tackle these challenges head-on and create a brighter future for all.</p>
